# Impromptu Analysis: Kaggle Survey 2021

## Project Overview
This project simulates an impromptu analysis scenario where an intern data analyst is given 20 minutes to draw insights from the 2021 Kaggle Users Survey dataset. The goal is to showcase how quick exploratory data analysis (EDA) can provide valuable insights even with limited time.

## Project Structure
- `impromptu analysis of kaggle survey.ipynb`: This Colab script Notebook contains the Python code and analysis for the impromptu analysis. It demonstrates the steps taken by the intern data analyst to explore the dataset and extract meaningful insights.
- `kaggle_users_survey.csv`: The CSV file containing the modified 2021 Kaggle Users Survey data.

## How to Run
1. Download or clone this repository.
2. Open the `impromptu analysis of kaggle survey.ipynb` notebook in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab.
3. Ensure the `kaggle_users_survey.csv` file is in the same directory as the notebook.
4. Follow the instructions in the notebook to execute the code cells and view the analysis results.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the power of quick exploratory data analysis in extracting valuable insights from datasets, even under time constraints. It serves as a reminder that data analysis doesn't always require extensive preparation and can provide actionable insights in a short amount of time.
