I am writing to express some concerns regardingthe service and treatment of delivery drivers at your McDonald's establishment inBognor Regis.During my visits to your restaurant as a delivery driver, I've noticed instances wherethere were delays in preparing orders for delivery, and it seemed that some of thedelivery drivers were not being treated with the level of respect they deserve. It appears that there may be instances of staff members engaging in conversations and taking longer than necessary to pack orders, leading to prolonged waiting times fordelivery drivers.Understanding that delivery drivers are compensated based on completing ordersand often face additional expenses such as insurance payments while waiting fororders, I believe it's important to ensure that their time is respected and valued.I've heard from some drivers that they feel frustrated by the extended wait times andthe lack of acknowledgment of their time and effort. I believe that creating a positiveand respectful environment for all individuals, including delivery drivers, is essentialfor the smooth operation of your establishment.I kindly request that you consider reviewing the staffing levels in the home deliverysection to ensure that orders can be prepared efficiently and delivered promptly.Additionally, fostering a culture of respect and appreciation for all individuals,regardless of their role, would greatly contribute to the overall experience at yourrestaurant.All the other drivers who share these concerns are also encouraged to express their agreement by signing this letter. We are prepared to escalate this matter to the media if significant improvements are not seen in this establishment very soon.\",\n"," 'Ordered a mcdelivery this morning and the driver rang twice to find us I told him where we were and that I was at the door waiting he then preceded to deliver to a different street and apparently the photo of the door is all he needs as proof (my door is white the door he chose is black) refused a refund from uber eats as this was proof enough I will avoid using this app for delivery as uber eats are just robbing people and allowing there drivers to do what they want this was from burnley Road mcdonalds Blackburn',\n"," 'I ordered a Happy Meal and asked for a book.

However I recieved shocking and disrespectful treatment from management!I am heavily pregnant and went to this Mcdonalds for lunch. On arrival I wished to use the toilets and my husband asked the lovely front of house customer service staff member if I could use the disabled toilet. Unfortunately someone else nipped in there at that moment. The lovely staff member unlocked the other downstairs toilet for me. I really appreciated that as since being pregnant using lifts makes me feel sick and I am unsteady on stairs.I enjoyed my meal and time with my husband. And as is very common when heavily pregnant I needed to use the toilet again before leaving. I went and spoke to the front of house staff member who had unlocked the downstairs toilet for me beforehand and she said speak to my colleague behind the desk to do it as she was in the process of emptying the bins. I went up to the counter and asked the staff member there. He didn't seem certain so checked with his manager who told him to tell me that he wasn't allowed to unlock the toilet door for me as there was a lift. He seemed very unhappy about passing on this news to me. I said it's because I'm pregnant and he went back to his manager. The response was still the same!Mortified, feeling very triggered and anxious (I have generalised anxiety disorder which under the Equality Act 2010 classes me as disabled) I said that's very odd as it wasn't a problem earlier, but, no problem. I felt embarrassed, humiliated and anxious so I didn't want to make a fuss or challenge further so despite lifts making me feel terribly sick I used the lift and went to the upstairs toilets.On leaving Mcdonald's the first front of house staff member I spoke to apologised to me and my husband about the matter and she seemed shocked at what had happened. I appreciated her apology and my husband and I explained the situation further (about lifts making me feel sick, etc). I also expressed wishes that this matter be fedback to the manager and that I would like the manager to be aware that I had asked for access for a reason and not just to be awkward. She said she would pass my feedback to a higher up manager.I am absolutely disgusted! If I had the chance I would like to say to this manager that not all disabilities / needs are visible and please can you be mindful that. Because if someone is asking for access to the disabled or downstairs toilets, they are asking for a reason and not to be awkward!Also I wonder, what is the point of having downstairs toilets if you prohit and pick and choose who can uses them? Obviously the installed lift meets access needs so all the toilets could be upstairs?It just feels very ridiculous! Please pass this review on (espcially to others who are pregnant / have hidden disabilities) to be wary of managerial attitudes in this Mcdonald's!I would like to conclude that I highly appreciate and commend the work and care of the front of house staff but the manager in my opinion needs to improve their customer service skills and compassion when it comes to serving customers with additional needs/ disabilities!Thanks for reading.\",\n"," 'MCDONALDS SUPPORT GENOCIDE 🇵🇸 AND THEYRE WORKERS GET PAID LESS THEN MINIMUM WAGE 🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸# BOYCOTT MCDONALDS 💩💩',\n"," \"Today, I placed an order with McDonalds in Hereford via Just Eat which was an absolute disaster, cold, unhygienic and inedible food! As the food arrived very cold and late after over one hour! With items missing and the drinks spilt! After being told various lies by both Just Eat via online updates and by my local McDonalds branch in Hereford. When I phoned them after over an hour to find out where my order was! They lied to me and said that my order had not been cooked yet and will not be cooked until a driver had been assigned. Which they were still waiting for. Then after putting the phone down to them, the driver arrived on his motorbike just 4 minutes after I spoke with McDonalds Hereford Branch. The driver lied as well and tried to tell me that the food was not cold!As the updates by Just Eat were a complete lie as well! As I felt the delivery food bag and it was stone cold! So I said that the food is cold and I have been waiting for over one hour and I do not want it and I handed back to the delivery driver and told him to take it back and that I want a full refund or a fresh order! At first, he lied to me and tried to tell me that the food was not cold. However, I did not believe him, espeically as we have had this problem before with Just Eat and McDonalds. Therefore, I asked him how long had he been driving around with my order in his motorbike box and he eventually admitted that it was for over 50 Minutes! Therefore, the food was not only cold but also, as it contained cooked meet unhygienic, unsafe to eat and completely inedible! So I said again that I do not want the order and asked him to take it back and refund me! He just said, Don't blame me, I am just the driver and they sent me all the way over there and then all the way over here.I closed the door and watched him drive away. Then I opened the door and he had left the order in the bags on the doorstep. When I opened the bags, the food was indeed cold, unsafe and inedible! Also, the Halloumi fries @ £3.29 were missing! Also, The two cups of coke were spilt!Although some takeaways use Just Eat riders many use there own!Therefore, I have requested a full refund of £21.98 from Just Eat.Otherwise, I will take legal action against Just Eat and McDonalds!\",\n"," \"My recent visit to McDonald's left me deeply disappointed on multiple fronts. From the moment I stepped foot into the establishment, it was evident that the standards of quality and customer service were sorely lacking.First and foremost, the cleanliness of the restaurant was appalling. Tables were grimy, floors were sticky, and the overall ambiance was more reminiscent of a neglected dive bar than a family-friendly eatery. The sight of overflowing trash bins and unattended spills only added to the general sense of neglect.Moving on to the service, it was nothing short of abysmal. Despite the relatively small crowd, the wait times were unreasonably long. The staff appeared disinterested and overwhelmed, with little regard for the customers' time or satisfaction. Requests for assistance were met with indifference, and any semblance of efficiency seemed to be nonexistent.Now, let's talk about the food – or lack thereof. The quality of the meals served at McDonald's has steadily declined over the years, and my recent experience only served to reaffirm this observation. The burgers were dry and tasteless, the fries were limp and cold, and even the supposedly refreshing beverages tasted watered down and uninspired. It's clear that freshness and flavor are not priorities for this establishment.To add insult to injury, the prices at McDonald's are utterly unjustifiable given the dismal quality of the fare. Paying a premium for subpar food and service is nothing short of insulting to the customer's intelligence and wallet. It's high time for McDonald's to reassess its pricing strategy and offer better value for money to its patrons.In conclusion, my visit to McDonald's was a regrettable mistake that I won't be repeating anytime soon. The combination of poor cleanliness, abysmal service, and lackluster food quality makes it abundantly clear that this establishment has lost touch with what truly matters – satisfying its customers. Until significant improvements are made across the board, I would advise others to steer clear of McDonald's and explore alternative dining options that prioritize quality and customer satisfaction.\",\n"," 'I ordered from the app today delivered from the Harrogate store, it arrived stone cold I called the helpline number on the app to be told over and over again \"I understand your not satisfied and your food was cold but we cant refund on this occasion\" I was refused a manager when I requested to speak to someone higher, I just wont be using them again, what a waste of £20!',\n"," \"I placed a very simple order with McDonald's bell green Sydenham for delivery I ordered 20 chicken nuggets with four sauces sweet curing and sweet and sour only I've got two sources one kit-up one sweet and sour it's not that hard to follow an order I then ordered a Oreo mini fluffy but only one of the ice cream so I ordered it with no pieces and an apple pie it arrived with Oreo pieces on top now it's really not that hard to read out and follow it because you have to read the order to send it because it's for delivery a fine things like this I find very frustrating having an autistic child with me trying to make it very quickly just to eat something because we've just got in the house from a trip and kind of been placed a quick order selectively doesn't like their food mixed so having loads of Oreo pieces practically caused the meltdown which I had to scrape off and then it wasn't bothered eating couldn't be eaten wasn't enough sources for 20 chicken nuggets two sauces one of them which we obviously didn't want because we didn't answer the catch up.

I said no I ordered a big tasty meal which was added as just the burger no meal, she asked if there was anything else, again stated i dont want just the burger I wanted the meal, which was added but the other stuff i didnt order was still on the screen, i yelled to say that i dont want bacon double cheeseburger or seperate drink. i was then advised to go to the next window as I was rather infuriated about how such a simple order can be taken so wrong and the other lane being prioritised over my order when they showed up after me, went to the window and another server started taking my order, stated big tasty with bacon meal, which was added, she asked what drink again said coke zero please, oh yes you did say sorry, anything else, i stated the big tasty by itself was still showing on the order, reply was i havent removed it yet, same with the single drink added and the bacon double cheeseburger, getting really fed up of people not listening and this being the same woman who told me it was my fault for not checking the order on the screen previously, i said they are still showing, by this time she was asking for payment with the excess food and drink on the order, i said no i want those removed, she replied will do in a moment, thats £18. odd, advised its not when the items are removed, she  then moaned about she was about to remove them as soon as I paid, advised her this isnt how it works its bad enough having 1 incompetent worker not taking the order correctly, quite another to have the person who takes over to correct the issue to make the same mistakes and worse. eventually items are removed, in all the diabolical ordering issues i realised i forgot to add latte for my wife, pulled forward a small amount to go to the next window, at which point 1 of the cars that had jumped ahead of me as their order was taken quickly by my server, started beeping his horn because he could see the staff talking while his order was going cold at the window waiting to be given to him, after about 2 minutes they eventually handed the food over, he made some comment about how useless they were. another customer got their food then and again made a comment about how slow the service was, eventually i get to the window get my food, big tasty was suddenly no bacon, asked for the latte for my wife, told sorry its not on the order and i have no till to take the payment. they have done this in the past no issue, i believe it was because i had become irate but never impolite or swearing over how they could fail to take a quite simple order and get it so wrong? couldnt even be bothered to go back around or into the store to complain my big tasty with bacon had no bacon, wouldnt trust the staff not to do something to the burger.

I've completed a couple of direct reviews recently on their site.Unfortunately if I had to review McDonalds in Sunderland town centre it would be no stars.I've been twice recently and after ordering on the online display I've had a message that my receipt can't be printed. They also cannot display your order number either, making it a right hassle to collect your food.I ordered on the display board today and this happened again. I found a member of Staff and explained what had happened and she told me the machines weren't working properly today and Staff would be shouting out details of the order as well as the order number.I did think this could cause problems as more than one person may have ordered the same thing.I then joined the queue for food and to my annoyance, found that the Staff weren't shouting out details of the order and were just shouting the order number.I then had to find the member of Staff again and told her the serving Staff at the counter weren't shouting out details of the order.A couple next to me weren't happy either and told me the machine they used wasn't showing their order number or producing a receipt, but some people were getting receipts.I got my food pretty quickly and asked the woman who served me if it was possible to get a receipt as I wanted to do a review.She and another member of Staff attempted to get me one, but after a few minutes of my food cooling down,  I told her not to bother. I told her I would just do a trust pilot review instead as I wasn't happy at all.This was met with indifference.Can McDonalds please sort out their machines. This also happened in the Newcastle cafe, opposite Eldon Square, so isn't an isolated incident.If your machines aren't working please formulate some kind of plan so your customers aren't getting stressed.I think the morale of this review is to order at the counter because you can't trust the machines.Although I use McDonalds pretty regularly I don't use the app. On the 2 occasions I used it the order didn't go through.The IT systems at McDonalds need seriously sorting out.It's a shame, because I think McDonalds coffees are better than most places and their food is good.\",\n"," 'My McDonalds was never delivered by Uber Eats.

This is quite frankly the worst McDonald's I have ever visited and I would strongly recommend you eat elsewhere or just avoid LAMBTRAD, the franchisee and their restaurants.I actually feel empathy for the McDonald's brand as overall I believe they do a good job but this particular franchise is disgusting as they let down the McDonald's brand on so many levels.The restaurant is staffed by inexperienced junior management and staff who act like its a playground, which is concerning when you consider health & safety and food standards.  The restaurant offers and advertises products and promotions but declines to honour them when you try to purchase, this is quite common when the franchisee is expected to take a lower margin for greater volume based on a national promotion set by the franchisor, McDonalds.The food was available, they just didn't want to sell it for less due to the current promotion. Such profiteering is considered distasteful.The incompetent staff are rude and inexperienced in dealing with everyday queries, it is shame McDonalds no longer does the stars on the name badges scheme as in this restaurant they would all be SNOWFLAKES, not stars and maxed out at 5!When you try to give feedback or make reasonable enquiries you are stonewalled by a gang of juveniles so all you can do is take your complaint higher and its often easier dealing with adults.From this point I did manage to speak to McDonalds directly but the actual franchisee and their non-existent customer service team just ignore all opportunities to engage, I think they have learned that its better this way so they don't then have to waste any time making things better or doing things professionally.Looking at other reviews for this particular restaurant it appears my own genuine feedback is neither new nor unique so LAMBTRAD has clearly had opportunities to improve but obviously doesn't care.In summary, McDonalds are probably toothless too so the whole thing limps along whilst they all make their money.  What a shame for the brand, a shame for the customers and a shame for franchising in general.I don't expect a response and like their burgers, this feedback will probably just sit there being ignored whilst it goes cold.\",\n"," 'My wife was in the toilet when staff banged the hell out of door saing really bad lines ie this is not a sleeping place , get out etcPoor girl was there 3 minutes onlyShr is still in shock......!',\n"," 'Just fetched a Big Mac chicken sandwich!

We ordered a delivery through the McDonalds app. Part of he order was wrong; one of the burgers that was supposed to have no mustard, onions or gherkins on it had all three. You can’t just scrape it off and eat it because it leaves a residue that makes it taste unpleasant  to those who don’t like these things That burger was inedible and we couldn’t swap because both burgers were the same. The hot and cold drinks were packed side by side in the same bag compromising the temperature of both drinks. All the food was stone cold and  judging by the speed at which the delivery arrived and the temperature of the food; I would guess it was probably prepared in advance of orders rather than freshly to order.Despite the meal being ordered and paid for through the McDonalds app; customer services were unhelpful and want to pass responsibility for their failing on to Uber. They said if we wanted a refund we would have to take it up with Uber since they were the delivery service and they only refund click and collect at Mc Donald’s Customer services. However Contract law states that If you have paid via an app, your contract is always with the outlet for the food that you have ordered and paid for.. The contract is always with whoever was paid,for the food (in this case McDonalds) whether it is via an app or by debit / credit card. The outlet may try and fob the customer off and say that they need to speak to whoever delivered it but the customer did not choose to engage Uber, Deliveroo, Just Eat,  or anyone else to deliver the food – that arrangement was made by the outlet and the customer had no say in it.  McDonald's have a contract with Uber for delivery services but we don’t. Our contract is with McDonalds.Anyway how can you blame the Uber driver who arrived before the appointed time for mistakes on the order and for food which should have arrived hot given the time frame and the insulated box he used to bring it? That is not the responsibility of the delivery driver  - they have no control over the food preparation and packing; that is what the restaurant staff.are paid to do.Given the huge mark- up and profit on takeaway food; and the size of McDonald’s as a company; I expected better: from the food, from the restaurant staff and from customer services .\",\n"," 'I guess my review here will just be a bit more of white noise since I don’t see McDonalds really responding to much of the complaints.I get the chain. Cheap food so you can expect low quality. My gripe is specifically with the chicken sandwich. Recently if you have noticed, there was a big uptick in chicken wars advertising between all the fast food retailers. This being the case, typically during this kind of situation, each retailer makes it a point to have the best in its class in that specific food item. McDonalds in this case decide to boast about how great, fresh and “juicy” their McCrispy sandwich is. Well that is a complete lie. I’ve gotten several in the past month and they are all the same. Really dry, rubbery, and tasteless. Just a result of really poor poultry meat. Now if you want some kind of moisture, I suggest you smother it in extra mayo but, I hate mayo so I’m stuck with eating the chicken as it is with pickles.Hey McDonalds. This is for you. If you are going to advertise you have the best in class for that product, follow through with your promise or just don’t make false claims just to boost sales and compete with the real specialty chicken focused franchises like KFC and Popeys.  If you can’t compete, then don’t even try. Place your advertising on the products you know you make well. Like you breakfast sandwiches.
